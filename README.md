# TicTacToe

This application is developed using JavaFX and gives you two difficulty options of easy or hard and the ability to choose whether to go first or second. 

The AI will follow [Newell and Simon's 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy) Strategy when played on Hard mode.
